# gene_game
A little life game made to test programming with rust.

It includes a primitive 2d renderer to display the world:

The blue pixels denote food(the more blue it is the more food there is).

Commands:
 - Space: pause the simulation
 - Escape: exit the simulation
 - Left click: shows Tile/Creature infos
 - Num Pad 1: sets rendering to creature diet(green = herbivores, red = carnivores, yellow = omnivores)
 - Num Pad 2: sets rendering to creature gene complexity(the greener the more genes)
